I'm always open for anyone's contribution on adding more translations for BSL Shaders, credits will be given.
Any language can be contributed by any amount of contributor, and I'm currently not accepting work in progress (WIP) files.
- You can start by making a copy of the `en_US.lang` file.
- Rename the copied file based on your language's [locale code](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language).
- Translate everything after the equals sign of each line.
- Fork this repository.
- Add your translated lang file to the repository.
- Commit and push your repository changes.
- Create a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository.
